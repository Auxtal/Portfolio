## Question 1

> **Define the word "Sampling". Discuss its origins, use, and impact within the context of the creative arts? What are some of the legalities involved with using macro and micro samples? How have distribution companies like "Splice" affected the culture?**

Sampling is a creative process that entails taking samples, or fragments from previously published works and incorporating them into fresh compositions. Sampling which has its roots in the electronic and hip-hop movements of the 1970s and 1980s, has greatly influenced the arts, especially music by allowing creators to recreate, reinterpret, and innovate.

The development of sampling has been characterized by both artistic inventiveness and difficult legal issues. It enables musicians to experiment with sounds, mix genres, and weave together various musical parts. New musical genres and groundbreaking musical styles that defy convention have resulted from this.

The legal ramifications of sampling, however, are complicated. When employing samples, which require reusing previously published work protected by copyright, copyright issues are crucial. To prevent copyright infringement, it is essential to seek authorization from the original creators or licenses through clearance organizations. The idea of "fair use" adds another level of complexity because different jurisdictions have different restrictions on how much a sample can be used without authorization.

Macro and micro samples are two types of sampling. Macro samples frequently require rigorous clearance procedures because they make up sizable amounts of production. However, it may be argued that micro samples, which consist of shorter, less recognizable fragments, are sufficiently transformative to qualify as fair usage.

The introduction of platforms like Splice has transformed sampling techniques. Such distribution organizations make high-quality sound resources accessible to artists by providing huge libraries of samples, loops, and presets. These platforms enable the creative process and give artists more influence, but they also encourage debates over originality and artistic legitimacy. Due to the extensive use of comparable samples, worries have been raised regarding a potential standardization of music.

In conclusion, sampling has expanded the parameters of artistic innovation, particularly in music production. It has sparked creative exploration and posed a threat to established aesthetic paradigms. The complexity of sample law nevertheless emphasizes the significance of ethical and knowledgeable creative practices. Platforms like Splice have expanded the reach of sampling and encouraged discussions about originality, creativity, and the future of artistic expression.

## Question 2

> **Why has a 1983 computer technology, version 1.0, still got immense relevance in 2022's global music industry? (FYI 1983's biggest available hard drive was 10MB) Why is MIDI 2.0 only just being developed now?**

1. **Universality**: MIDI 1.0 is still useful for the following reasons, to name a few. MIDI works universally across a diverse amount brands and types of instruments, which developed a standardized protocol for communication between musical instruments. Musicians and producers can now link a variety of instruments and equipment, regardless of where they are from, thanks to its universality.

1. **Versatility**: MIDI's capacity to send dynamics, modulation, and pitch information in addition to musical notes has made it possible to manipulate sound intricacies. This adaptability is essential for contemporary music creation, which calls for fine control over a wide range of parameters for electronic and hybrid music genres.

1. **Low Bandwidth**: Because MIDI messages are brief and use little data capacity, they are effective for communication even in contexts with limited resources. This effectiveness is particularly pertinent in situations like live concerts and studio recording when low-latency communication is required.

1. **Legacy Instruments and Systems**: The MIDI 1.0 standard was the foundation for many vintage synthesizers, drum machines, and other pieces of musical equipment from the 1980s and on. To connect vintage equipment with contemporary setups, MIDI 1.0 is a crucial communication protocol because these instruments continue to be valuable and well-liked among artists.

However, MIDI 2.0 is now being developed to overcome the constraints and changing requirements of contemporary music creation. While MIDI 1.0 is still useful, it does have several drawbacks, such as the inability to handle expressive control, bidirectional connection, and high-resolution data. By adding improved functionalities, MIDI 2.0 intends to alleviate these limitations:

1. **Bidirectional Communication**: is made possible by MIDI 2.0, allowing for more intricate and dynamic interactions between software and hardware.

2. **Expressive Control**: With the increased support for expressive control data included in MIDI 2.0, such as continuous controllers and aftertouch, performances can become more subtle and emotive.

3. **Higher Resolution**: MIDI 2.0 provides higher-resolution data, which is essential for recording minute details in performances and sound processing.

In conclusion, MIDI 1.0's sustained importance in the music business is a result of its fundamental role in the creation of electronic music and its interoperability with a wide range of hardware and applications. With the introduction of capabilities that improve expressive control and bidirectional communication, MIDI 2.0 will respond to the changing requirements of contemporary music production. The musical environment is significantly shaped by each of these renditions. (Wright, 2023), (Tgerbrands, 2023)

## Question 3

> **Discuss some of the ways in which recording artists can share and distribute their ideas and products. Why is this culture so popular now?**

In the current digital era, recording artists have a variety of ways to share and promote their concepts and goods. The internet and the development of technology have changed how music is produced, distributed, and consumed. Here are a few methods for recording artists to share their work:

1. **Digital Streaming Services**: On services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, musicians can upload their songs for users to stream. The number of streams determines how much money is generated by this strategy, which provides exposure to a global audience.

2. **Online Music Shops**: With the help of platforms like iTunes and Google Play, musicians may sell their songs as digital downloads. This approach gives you the means to connect with listeners who want to purchase single songs or entire albums.

3. **YouTube And Video Sites**: Artists can make music videos or lyric films and upload them to video websites like YouTube. Video content engages viewers visually and can win over new followers.

4. **Social Media**: Sites like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok give artists a direct line of communication with their followers. They can connect in real-time and share music excerpts and behind-the-scenes material.

5. **Websites**: Having a personal website enables artists to promote their work, offer direct downloads or physical copies of their music, and sell merchandise.

6. **SoundCloud And Bandcamp**: Independent musicians can post and distribute their music on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, making it simple for listeners to find them and opening the door to future collaborations.

7. **Collaboration Tools**: Sites like Splice provide collaboration tools that enable musicians to work remotely on projects while exchanging tracks and ideas online.

8. **Livestreaming And Podcasts**: Musicians can present podcasts to engage with their audience and provide insights about their music. Real-time involvement is provided by live-streaming events like concerts, studio sessions, or Q&A sessions.

## My Work During The Trimester

During this trimester we learned a lot of things when it came to mixing. Throughout the first half of the trimester, we mixed one song every single week learning new mixing techniques. And looking more into techniques that we knew about before but in new ways and going more in-depth with them. My classmates and I each did three mixes of three songs. Here are my three Pro Tools sessions that you can download and have a look at:

## Week 1

For the first week, we learned more about drum mixing and we went over the following dot points about EQ and Compression, learning how to use it, when, and how. Things such as what settings you should use when applied in different aspects of a mix:

**The Start**:

1. Make sure the source is clean and recorded correctly if possible. Good-quality sounds will lead to a good-quality mix.

2. Gate things, delete and fade sections where necessary to remove the rubbish/noise and silence.

3. Gain staging, balance everything carefully!

**Using EQ / Compression**:

1. Checking things in context with the rest of the mix regularly (Don't leave on solo)

2. Subtractive before additive, make use of High Pass filters. In some cases Low Pass filters as well (E.G. Cymbals);

3. Don't compress frequencies you want removed, this will make them louder. Don't compress stuff you have boosted, this will simply turn that area back down.

4. Use parallel compression to bring up the body if you want. Higher ratios are used here.

5. Fast attack for transients on the individual sounds (E.G. Kick, Snare, Toms). Slower attack on the drum bus (This is a channel all your drum sounds dump into) to gel the entire collection of sounds together and get things sounding more cohesive. Some people will do this with a light ratio (2:1, 3:1) before gain staging the drum sounds themselves and making all their mix decisions through the compressor for cohesion.

**Spacing Things Out**:

1. Panning and Reverb to diffuse and place things in the stereo field.

2. Distortion, tone shaping, and additive EQ. Bring out some of the sonic qualities that you want more of in various instruments or the kist as a whole.

## Week 2

In week 2 we started to learn more about vocal processing and how to apply certain techniques in a mix and when. We went over the following dot points in class:

**Vocal Recording & Processing**:

- Communicate with the singer while recording, let them know what's going on and give feedback, and be clear.

- The performance is the key, sometimes things to improve the performance like adding reverb to the headphones on their voice can help.

- Use punch in recording, for example, three takes of each 16-bar "piece" of the song, or wherever makes sense.

- Matching the tone when punching in is the most important part.

- Compile all the best parts into a "master" take. Take the best overall take, and replace the bits that need to be enhanced from other takes.

- Gain match the various vocal clips manually if needed. Strip the silence, although the waveform may look empty, it has noise from a live microphone in there, get rid of it.

- Remove breaths, and leave a few in (Your favorite ones).

- Subtractive EQ, get rid of frequencies that are not adding anything substantial to the signal, E.G. everything under about 100Hz.

- Additive EQ and tone shaping, boost the highs to add intelligibility. Bring out anything else that you feel the vocal needs.

- Compression next, one fast compressor to catch the peaks, and one slower compressor (Bus stage) to gel everything together.

- De-essing if needed.

- Further tone shaping; saturation, distortion. Get creative!

- Add depth, delays (You can use multiple delays in small amounts), and reverb. Move the reverb amount up until you can hear the effect, then dial it back a notch. You should feel it more than hear it unless you are going for a very "wet" mix.

- Overdubs, add doubles to certain words or sentences that the singer wants to emphasize. These should be recorded separately from the main vocal line. This changes the tone, pitch, and timing slightly.

- Try removing some of the highs to make the overdubs sit behind the main vocal line. Add more delay or reverb to these again to emphasize the feel, and make these sit behind the main vocal.

- Backing vocals, can be panned as well. Use widening tools on these or even the main vocal (As a return auxiliary) if you like as well. Experiment with what sounds good in terms of the stereo spread.

- Bus all the vocals, and add further processing (Tape saturation?) to everything.

## Week 3

</Button>

In week 3 we didn't focus on any specific techniques but more applied what we had learned in the previous weeks to a new mix which in my case was Abbey May - Flirting. This mix is very interesting as it contains a lot of percussion and peculiar sounds in there. Feel free to download the session and have a look!
