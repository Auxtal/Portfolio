# Fringe Festival 2023

## Description

For Fringe Festival 2023, myself and my colleague John, setup and operated the audio-visual equipment for Fringe Festival at Tranby College. Over the duration of 4 days, we setup the stage and a temporary sound desk for technical rehearsals which we had for 2 days, and then the actual shows. We ended up running seven shows in total over the course of 2 days, some of which being solo singers, comedy acts, and a band.

## Equipment & Setup

- In terms of hardware this setup was basic, for the audio side of things we used the Mackie Onyx console at FOH. for IO we had a 30m Multicore running from the stage to FOH. We also had a portable mixer sitting on the table provided by the college. The only reason we had this setup was to run all the vocal mics through for FX such as reverb as the Mackie Onyx console didnâ€™t have any FX built in.

- For the Audio setup on the stage we had two generic wireless mics provided by the college and we also had 1 SM58. These mics were plugged into channels 1 and 2 on the Multicore, they then went through the portable mixer for FX then through the Mackie Onyx console and then back out through FOH L+R.

- For Lighting and video, I had my 2021 M1 MacBook Pro running Resolume, and my surface pro running GrandMA2 On PC. I also had my Akai APC40 MKII as a midi controller for Resolume. For Lighting we were using ArtNet to control the lights and I also sent ArtNet to Resolume as a secondary controller. This was useful in the case of just one show where I could simply program the video to change in a cue list so all I had to do was press space bar.

- When it comes to the layout of the stage, we had two basic lighting Truss bars that held up 2 RGB Led par cans each, the two inner ones were positioned as a center spot and the two outer ones were positioned on the curtains to provide a nice colour wash. We also had one extra par can which I decided to put just behind the TV point up in the center of the curtains.

## Software

For this festival we used a variety of different software which include the following. For lighting we used GrandMA2 On PC, for video we used Resolume, and for audio playback we used QLab.
