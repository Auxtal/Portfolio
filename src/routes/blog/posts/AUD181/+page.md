## Research Question 1

**Use the Week 1 in class activity as a basis for discussing the concept of a 'song' vs a 'production' or 'arrangement'. Does one work without the other? Are they equality important in conveying the energy or message of a song?**

A song is an original piece of musical work done by either the songwriter and or the composer. Compared to an arrangement which is not so much a remix but more of a rearrangement of the song hence the name an 'arrangement'. This is where you take a pre existing piece of work and re arrange it in a way that you like this is typically done by producers when a track or rough song is provided to them by an artist. In terms of "Does one work without the other?", the answer is yes and no. You can just release a song but if it hasn't gone through the work of a producer re arranging the song it may not have the style or outcome that you're after. When it comes to the importance of the energy or message of the song I think yes they are just equally as important, due to the fact that without a song or "reference track" doing an arrangement would be very difficult and a lot of the vibes or message your going for could be discarded. (Carlos, 2020)

## Research Question 2

**Choose a DAW other than Pro Tools or Ableton and discuss some of the reasons that it may be used as an alternative. Who are some of the well known creatives to use this DAW as their primary tool and why do they choose it?**

Cubase! There are many professional music producers that use cubase, such as; Hans Zimmer, an Kirkpatrick, Ludwig Göransson, Cirkut, and Alan Silvestri. Why do they use it? For composers who want to incorporate numerous synthesisers and samples into their music, Cubase is a well-liked DAW that is mostly MIDI and plugin instrument based (also known as VSTi's). It is also excellent at recording audio tracks. (Zamri, 2022)
