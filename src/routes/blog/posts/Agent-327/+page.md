## Description

"Agent 327" is the animation of choice that our group chose for Project 2 in our AUD213 unit. The goal of the project is to choose an animation and remake all of the audio for said animation. This includes the dialog, foley, music, and ambiance. This was probably the biggest project that I have done so far in my time at SAE. The project itself was run throughout the whole trimester (12 Weeks).

## Synopsis

"Agent 327" is a secret agent working for the Netherlands secret service agency. He's investigating a clue that leads him to a shady backstreet barbershop. Little does he know that he's being tailed by the infamous mercenary Boris Kloris.

In the twenty comic books that were published since 1968, Martin Lodewijk created a rich universe with international conspiracies, hilarious characters, and a healthy dose of Dutch humor. This three-minute teaser for a full-length animated feature is based on Dutch artist Martin Lodewijkâ€™s classic comics series Agent 327.

## Process

The final product we'd been working hard on throughout the Trimester is something we're all very proud of, and considering the short turnover time we genuinely think it compares pretty closely to the original, if not better.

Every sound in the animation has been completely recreated from scratch, from the Dialogue (Thanks to David Jin) to all of the music and sound effects (Except for the hair dryer sparks).

The SFX was created by recording everyday objects, layering & manipulating the audio to eventually have something that's both realistic & convincing. This process is called Foley and encompasses all the different sounds from footsteps, punches, fire & much more.

Once the Foley & Music were finalised we then mixed it all in full 5.1 surround sound for Theatre & Cinema environments, making sure to adhere to industry norms for loudness (-24LUFS. -2DBFS True Peak), as well as a 'Downmixed' stereo version for at home & online viewing.
